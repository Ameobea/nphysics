This file contains scenarios that have been shown to behave strangely at some point of the
development. Those are small, special cases.

At the beginning of each file is a comment explaining why this example is relevant, and how it has
been fixed from an algorithmic point of view.

Visualizing those demos is a good way to verify that no stability regression occurred after some
algorithmic changes.
